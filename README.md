# MushroomGenerator

Hello,

This basic program create proceduraly generated mushrooms in .png. It randomly overlays the images in the "img" directory to create unique mushrooms. These end up in "mushs".

This is only a demo: I am not the owner of the artworks that are used!

AFP: Adapted some features and put a code to merge the images in a 3*8 or any width or height you want.
